# Ultra Debugger

An automated debugging tool for AI-generated software. The Ultra Debugger system consists of multiple components that work together to analyze, debug, and fix code generated by AI systems.

## Components

### 1. Code Analyzer (`src/scripts/codeAnalyzer.js`)
Performs static code analysis to identify potential issues in AI-generated code:
- Undefined variables
- Unreachable code
- Potential infinite loops
- Resource leaks (event listeners, timers, XMLHttpRequests)
- Missing error handling
- Array index out of bounds access
- Function complexity

### 2. Runtime Debugger (`src/scripts/runtimeDebugger.js`)
Executes dynamic analysis on the code:
- Safe code execution in sandboxed environment
- Memory usage monitoring
- Automated test execution with various input types
- Error tracking

### 3. Auto Fixer (`src/scripts/autoFixer.js`)
Automatically fixes or suggests fixes for detected issues:
- Removes unreachable code
- Adds error handling
- Warns about potential resource leaks
- Fixes variable initialization issues
- Suggests improvements for undefined variables
- Suggests refactoring for complex functions

### 4. Debug Controller (`src/middleware/debugController.js`)
Middleware that orchestrates the entire debugging process:
- Coordinates all components
- Generates comprehensive reports
- Saves results to files
- Provides programmatic interface

### 5. MCP Server (`src/mcp/mcp-server.js`)
Model Context Protocol server that allows integration with MCP-compatible tools:
- Exposes debugging functionality as MCP tools
- Can be used with AI assistants and IDEs that support MCP
- Provides structured responses for debugging results

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ultra-debugger

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Debug a single file
node ultra-debugger.js path/to/your/file.js

# Debug a file and specify output directory
node ultra-debugger.js path/to/your/file.js -o ./results

# Debug multiple files
node ultra-debugger.js file1.js file2.js file3.js -m

# Debug without saving report or fixed code
node ultra-debugger.js app.js --no-report --no-fixed

# Get help
node ultra-debugger.js --help
```

### MCP Server Mode

```bash
# Run as an MCP server
npm run mcp
```

### Programmatic Usage

```javascript
const DebugController = require('./src/middleware/debugController.js');

const controller = new DebugController({
  saveReport: true,
  saveFixedCode: true,
  outputDir: './results'
});

// Debug a single file
controller.debug('path/to/file.js')
  .then(report => {
    console.log('Debug report:', report);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Debugging failed:', error);
  });

// Debug multiple files
controller.debugMultiple(['file1.js', 'file2.js', 'file3.js'])
  .then(results => {
    console.log('Multiple file debug results:', results);
  });
```

## MCP Tools

When running in MCP mode, the Ultra Debugger exposes the following tools:

1. **debug_file** - Debug a single JavaScript file
   - Parameters: `file_path` (string)

2. **debug_multiple_files** - Debug multiple JavaScript files
   - Parameters: `file_paths` (array of strings)

3. **get_last_debug_report** - Get the detailed report from the last debug operation
   - No parameters

4. **get_fix_suggestions** - Get suggestions for fixing issues found in the last debug operation
   - No parameters

## Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration

The Ultra Debugger supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which enables integration with AI assistants and development tools. This allows AI systems to automatically debug code they've generated or are working with.

### What is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol that enables secure communication between AI assistants and external tools. It standardizes how AI systems can access and interact with tools, making it easier to extend their capabilities.

### Benefits of MCP Integration

1. **AI Assistant Integration**: Works with Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI assistants that support MCP
2. **Automated Debugging**: AI assistants can automatically debug code without manual intervention
3. **Structured Responses**: Provides structured data that AI assistants can easily process and interpret
4. **Tool Discovery**: AI assistants can automatically discover available debugging tools

### Running in MCP Mode

To run the Ultra Debugger as an MCP server:

```bash
npm run mcp
```

This starts the server in stdio mode, which can be connected to by any MCP-compatible client.

See [MCP_DOCUMENTATION.md](MCP_DOCUMENTATION.md) for detailed information about the MCP implementation.

## How It Works

1. **Static Analysis**: The Code Analyzer scans the source code without executing it to find potential issues.

2. **Runtime Analysis**: The Runtime Debugger executes the code in a safe sandboxed environment to monitor its behavior.

3. **Auto-fixing**: The Auto Fixer applies automatic fixes where possible and suggests improvements for more complex issues.

4. **Reporting**: The Debug Controller combines all results into a comprehensive report and can save both the report and fixed code to files.

## Features

- **Safe Execution**: Code is executed in a sandboxed environment to prevent harmful operations.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Both static and dynamic analysis techniques are employed.
- **Automated Fixes**: Many common issues are automatically fixed.
- **Detailed Reporting**: In-depth reports with issues, warnings, and suggestions.
- **Multiple File Support**: Can debug single files or batches of files.
- **Configurable Output**: Control what gets saved and where.
- **Enhanced Detection**: Improved detection of AI-specific code issues.
- **MCP Integration**: Can be used with MCP-compatible tools and AI assistants.

## Limitations

- The current implementation simulates some behaviors for safety reasons.
- Complex logical errors may not be detected.
- Some fixes are only suggested rather than automatically applied.
- Memory monitoring is simulated in this example.

## Recent Improvements

- Enhanced static analysis with more detection patterns
- Better automatic fixing capabilities
- Improved reporting with categorized issues
- More flexible CLI options
- Enhanced sandboxing with more built-in functions
- Better multi-file debugging support
- MCP server mode for integration with AI tools

## Future Improvements

- Integration with more advanced static analysis tools
- Enhanced sandboxing for safer code execution
- Machine learning-based bug detection and fixing
- Support for more programming languages
- Web-based dashboard for visualizing debug reports
- Integration with popular development environments
- Automated refactoring suggestions
- Enhanced MCP tool capabilities
