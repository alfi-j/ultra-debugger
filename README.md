# Ultra Debugger

An automated debugging tool for AI-generated software. The Ultra Debugger system consists of multiple components that work together to analyze, debug, and fix code generated by AI systems.

## Components

### 1. Code Analyzer (`src/scripts/codeAnalyzer.js`)
Performs static code analysis to identify potential issues in AI-generated code:
- Undefined variables
- Unreachable code
- Potential infinite loops
- Resource leaks (event listeners, timers, XMLHttpRequests)
- Missing error handling
- Array index out of bounds access
- Function complexity

### 2. Runtime Debugger (`src/scripts/runtimeDebugger.js`)
Executes dynamic analysis on the code:
- Safe code execution in sandboxed environment
- Memory usage monitoring
- Automated test execution with various input types
- Error tracking

### 3. Auto Fixer (`src/scripts/autoFixer.js`)
Automatically fixes or suggests fixes for detected issues:
- Removes unreachable code
- Adds error handling
- Warns about potential resource leaks
- Fixes variable initialization issues
- Suggests improvements for undefined variables
- Suggests refactoring for complex functions

### 4. Debug Controller (`src/middleware/debugController.js`)
Middleware that orchestrates the entire debugging process:
- Coordinates all components
- Generates comprehensive reports
- Saves results to files
- Provides CLI interface

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to the project directory
cd ultra-debugger
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Debug a single file
node ultra-debugger.js path/to/your/file.js

# Debug a file and specify output directory
node ultra-debugger.js path/to/your/file.js -o ./results

# Debug multiple files
node ultra-debugger.js file1.js file2.js file3.js -m

# Debug without saving report or fixed code
node ultra-debugger.js app.js --no-report --no-fixed

# Get help
node ultra-debugger.js --help
```

### Programmatic Usage

```javascript
const DebugController = require('./src/middleware/debugController.js');

const controller = new DebugController({
  saveReport: true,
  saveFixedCode: true,
  outputDir: './results'
});

// Debug a single file
controller.debug('path/to/file.js')
  .then(report => {
    console.log('Debug report:', report);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Debugging failed:', error);
  });

// Debug multiple files
controller.debugMultiple(['file1.js', 'file2.js', 'file3.js'])
  .then(results => {
    console.log('Multiple file debug results:', results);
  });
```

## How It Works

1. **Static Analysis**: The Code Analyzer scans the source code without executing it to find potential issues.

2. **Runtime Analysis**: The Runtime Debugger executes the code in a safe sandboxed environment to monitor its behavior.

3. **Auto-fixing**: The Auto Fixer applies automatic fixes where possible and suggests improvements for more complex issues.

4. **Reporting**: The Debug Controller combines all results into a comprehensive report and can save both the report and fixed code to files.

## Features

- **Safe Execution**: Code is executed in a sandboxed environment to prevent harmful operations.
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Both static and dynamic analysis techniques are employed.
- **Automated Fixes**: Many common issues are automatically fixed.
- **Detailed Reporting**: In-depth reports with issues, warnings, and suggestions.
- **Multiple File Support**: Can debug single files or batches of files.
- **Configurable Output**: Control what gets saved and where.
- **Enhanced Detection**: Improved detection of AI-specific code issues.

## Limitations

- The current implementation simulates some behaviors for safety reasons.
- Complex logical errors may not be detected.
- Some fixes are only suggested rather than automatically applied.
- Memory monitoring is simulated in this example.

## Recent Improvements

- Enhanced static analysis with more detection patterns
- Better automatic fixing capabilities
- Improved reporting with categorized issues
- More flexible CLI options
- Enhanced sandboxing with more built-in functions
- Better multi-file debugging support

## Future Improvements

- Integration with more advanced static analysis tools
- Enhanced sandboxing for safer code execution
- Machine learning-based bug detection and fixing
- Support for more programming languages
- Web-based dashboard for visualizing debug reports
- Integration with popular development environments
- Automated refactoring suggestions
